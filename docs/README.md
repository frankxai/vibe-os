## Quick Start

1. **Use headphones for binaural beats** (stereo files) - the effect requires different frequencies in each ear
2. **Speakers work for pure tones** (mono files) and isochronic tones
3. **Listen for 5+ minutes** - research shows effects require minimum exposure time

## How It Works

### 1. Pure Tones (Mono Files)

```
Sound Wave:  ∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿
             Continuous sine wave at specific frequency
```

**How they work**: A single frequency plays continuously. The specific Hz value may have physiological effects:
- **432 Hz**: Studies show reduced heart rate (-4.79 bpm) and blood pressure
- **528 Hz**: Research indicates reduced cortisol, increased oxytocin

**Works with**: Speakers or headphones

### 2. Binaural Beats (Stereo Files)

```
Left Ear:   ∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿  (e.g., 432 Hz)
Right Ear:  ∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿   (e.g., 438 Hz)
                              ↓
Brain:      ████████████████   Perceives 6 Hz "beat"
```

**How they work**: Different frequencies play in each ear. Your brain perceives the *difference* as a pulsing beat. This can entrain brainwaves to match.

**Brainwave States**:
| State | Beat Frequency | Effect |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Delta | 0.5-4 Hz | Deep sleep, healing |
| Theta | 4-8 Hz | Meditation, creativity |
| Alpha | 8-13 Hz | Relaxation, focus |
| Beta | 13-30 Hz | Alertness, concentration |
| Gamma | 30-100 Hz | Peak cognition, insight |

**CRITICAL**: Binaural beats **require headphones**. Without them, both ears hear both frequencies and no "beat" is perceived.

### 3. Isochronic Tones

```
Sound:  ████░░░░████░░░░████░░░░████
        ON  OFF  ON  OFF  ON  OFF
        (Pulsing at target brainwave frequency)
```

**How they work**: A single tone rapidly turns on/off at the target brainwave frequency. Unlike binaural beats, these work with speakers.

**Works with**: Speakers or headphones

## Why Schumann and 528 Hz May Sound Similar

If you're not using headphones, here's what happens:

**With Headphones** (CORRECT):
```
Schumann:  L: 432 Hz → Left ear only
           R: 440 Hz → Right ear only
           Brain perceives 7.83 Hz beat (theta/Schumann)

528 Hz:    Both ears: 528 Hz pure tone
           No beat, just continuous frequency
```

**Without Headphones** (INCORRECT for binaural):
```
Schumann:  Both ears hear 432 Hz AND 440 Hz mixed
           No binaural effect - sounds like buzzing chord

528 Hz:    Both ears hear 528 Hz
           Sounds like continuous tone
```

**The fix**: Use headphones for any stereo/binaural files.

## Troubleshooting

### "All files sound the same"
→ **Use headphones** for binaural beats (stereo files)

### "I don't feel anything"
→ Listen for minimum 5-10 minutes
→ Reduce external distractions
→ Effects are subtle, not dramatic

### "The tone is annoying"
→ Lower volume
→ Try files with pink noise added
→ Some people prefer isochronic over binaural

### "Which file should I use?"
→ See Usage Recommendations above
→ Match brainwave state to your goal
