# Suno Prompt Architect
## Professional Music Generation with Suno AI

This skill transforms musical intentions into precisely crafted Suno AI prompts that generate cinematic, emotionally resonant tracks suitable for professional use in Vibe OS sessions, meditation albums, and creator content.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Music as Consciousness Technology**
Every Suno-generated track should serve a transformative purpose - whether energizing a creative session, facilitating meditation, or soundtracking a creator's breakthrough moment.

**Prompt Engineering as Composition**
Writing Suno prompts is like composing a detailed arrangement. Every element matters: genre, mood, instrumentation, production quality, tempo, and energetic intention.

---

## Suno Prompt Anatomy

### The 5-Layer Structure

```
[FOUNDATION] + [MOOD] + [INSTRUMENTATION] + [PRODUCTION] + [INTENTION]
```

**1. FOUNDATION (Genre/Style)**
- Primary genre + fusion elements
- Reference aesthetic periods or movements
- Define rhythmic foundation

**2. MOOD (Emotional Landscape)**
- Core emotion (one word)
- Secondary feeling (supporting)
- Energy level (low/mid/high)

**3. INSTRUMENTATION (Sonic Palette)**
- Lead instruments (2-3 max)
- Rhythmic elements
- Atmospheric textures
- Avoid over-specifying

**4. PRODUCTION (Sonic Quality)**
- Mix characteristics (spacious, intimate, cinematic)
- Effects (reverb, delay, compression feel)
- Frequency balance
- Reference quality level

**5. INTENTION (Energetic Purpose)**
- What transformation should this create?
- Use case scenario
- Desired listener state

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a Suno prompt, verify:

- [ ] Clear genre/style foundation
- [ ] Specific mood descriptors (2-3 words)
- [ ] Instrumentation details (3-6 elements)
- [ ] Production quality specified
- [ ] Intention clearly stated
- [ ] Tempo or rhythmic feel indicated
- [ ] Appropriate for use case (meditation, work, motivation, etc.)
- [ ] Frequency specifications if healing/meditation
- [ ] Avoids over-specification (let Suno be creative)
- [ ] Reads naturally (not just keyword list)

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Too Generic**
"Relaxing music with piano"
- Missing: mood depth, production, intention, specificity

❌ **Over-Specified**
"C major scale piano with exactly 4 chords, reverb at 2.3 seconds, compressor at 4:1 ratio, EQ boost at 3kHz..."
- Too technical, Suno can't control that level of detail

❌ **Contradictory Elements**
"Energizing meditation for deep sleep"
- Conflicting intentions

❌ **Missing Intention**
Technically perfect prompt but no transformative purpose
- Lacks the magic that makes it meaningful
